#Sass-Time (Styling Rails Apps with SASS)

This is a sample Rails app (limited functionality -- Index action only) designed for the SASS lesson. 

You should be able to do a ```git pull``` and then a ```bundle install``` and ```rake db:seed``` to get this up and running.

Feel free to use this app as additional Rails practice after the lesson (finish out CRUD functionality, style some views differently, etc.).
